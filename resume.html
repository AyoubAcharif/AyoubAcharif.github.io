                                            skills to deal with unexpected challenges. I also improved my communication
                                            skills because I had to deliver peopleâ€™s letters and we spoke a lot with

                                        <div>My experience as a football coach at RSC Anderlecht, with the U7 section,
                                            has been an enriching experience that goes beyond sport. In this role, I had
                                            the honor of passing on footballing skills to young players. As a coach, my
                                            responsibilities extended beyond the pitch. I was tasked with designing and
                                            leading age-appropriate training sessions that focused not only on personal
                                            developing skills but also on a love of the sport, and the
                                            discipline.<br /><br />
                                            It was essential to create a positive and encouraging environment, allowing
                                            each player to blossom and develop a passion for the game. Working with the
                                            U7 age group required a specific, playful, and careful approach because I
                                            coached children and not adults so I had to be more familiar with them. I
                                            adapted the training programs to the developmental conditions of the
                                            players, emphasizing cooperation, coordination, sportsmanship, enjoyment of
                                            the game, and discipline. <br /><br />
                                            This experience enabled me to improve my communication skills considerably,
                                            ensuring that I conveyed instructions in a way that was clear and appealing
                                            to the young athletes. As well as the technical aspects of the game, I also
                                            looked after the emotional and social development of the players.
                                            Educational values such as discipline, determination, and respect became an
                                            integral part of their training.

                                        <div>During my three years specializing in industrial IT at the HELHa University
                                            College in Charleroi, I was immersed in a harmonious combination of theory
                                            and practical experience. The majority of my training focused on network
                                            management, and I developed an in-depth understanding of the design,
                                            optimization, and maintenance of network infrastructure. This includes
                                            mastering protocols, addressing schemes, and security measures to ensure
                                            seamless communication in industrial environments.<br /><br />

                                            Additionally, systems management has become a core competency as we deal
                                            with the complexities of configuring and maintaining complex industrial
                                            systems. This includes expertise in implementing, monitoring, and
                                            troubleshooting the various hardware and software components essential to
                                            industrial operations. <br /><br />


                                            When it comes to software programming, my education included a comprehensive
                                            exploration of programming languages essential to industrial applications.
                                            From low-level languages for embedded systems to high-level languages for
                                            polyvalent software solutions, I improved my skills in writing efficient and
                                            trusted code for industrial needs. <br /><br />


                                            Focusing on web development further extended my skills, allowing me to
                                            create user-friendly interfaces and web applications that allow seamless
                                            interaction with industrial processes. This comprehensive training not only
                                            provided me with the technical knowledge but also the problem-solving
                                            essential to managing the complexity of industrial IT environments.

                                            To celebrate the completion of this academic chapter, I acquired a solid
                                            foundation in network and systems administration, software programming, and
                                            web development. These competencies not only define my academic achievements

                                        <div>During my studies at INRACI in Brussels, I embarked on a journey in the IT
                                            field by completing an IT technician training course. This comprehensive
                                            program covered core aspects of network and systems management, providing me
                                            with a deep understanding of the infrastructure that underlies modern
                                            technology. From configuring and managing networks to ensuring the smooth
                                            operation of complex systems, I developed practical skills essential to a
                                            successful career in IT.<br /><br />

                                            The curriculum also introduced me to the world of software programming,
                                            increasing my proficiency in various programming languages. This aspect of
                                            my training has equipped me with the capability to develop effective
                                            software solutions for industry requirements. The focus on hands-on
                                            programming not only improved my programming skills but also cultivated a
                                            problem-solving mindset critical to tackling real-world IT
                                            challenges.<br /><br />

                                            The dynamic nature of INRACI's IT Technician course allowed us to stay
                                            up-to-date with industry trends and new technologies. This adaptability,
                                            combined with a strong foundation in network and systems administration and
                                            software programming, makes me a versatile and effective IT professional.
                                            Looking back on this period of growth in the discipline, I am eager to apply
                                            this knowledge to real-world settings and contribute to the ever-evolving
